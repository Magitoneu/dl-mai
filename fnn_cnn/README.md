# fnn_cnn

The file used for analyzing the dataset was dataset_analyzer.py 

The file used for all the experiments was indoor_classification_full.py, which loads all the dataset in memory. 
The file indoor_classification_batches.py, was the first version and it loads the dataset using batches (flow_from_directory),
which makes it a lot more slower than the other version.
